# Shift
Move background or long running jobs into reliable and durable processes out of your main application thread. Shift enables your application to easily run long running jobs in separate threads or processes. 

**Features:**
- Open source and free - including commercial use.
- Reliable and durable background and long running jobs.
- Out of band processing of long running jobs. 
- Ability to pause, stop, reset, and restart long running jobs.
- Auto removal of older jobs.
- Scale out with multiple Shift servers to run large number of jobs.
- Multiple options for persistent storage: Redis, MongoDB, Microsoft SQL server, or Azure DocumentDB. 
- Optional detailed, customizable progress tracking for each running jobs.
- Optional encryption for serialized data.
- Run Shift Server library in your own .NET apps, Azure WebJobs, or Windows services. Use nuget.org for easy integration.

The client library allows client apps to add jobs and send commands to Shift server to pause, stop, delete, reset, and run jobs.

A simple example of adding a job:
```
var job = new TestJob();
var jobID = jobClient.Add(() => job.Start("Hello world!"));
```

Adding a job asynchronously with even simpler job:
```
var jobID = await jobClient.AddAsync(() => Console.WriteLine("Hello world!"));
```

Add a long running job with a pause, cancellation token, and progress update:
```
var job = new TestJob();
var progress = new SynchronousProgress<ProgressInfo>();
var cancelToken = (new CancellationTokenSource()).Token; 
var pauseToken = (new PauseTokenSource()).Token;
var jobID = jobClient.Add("Shift.Demo.Client", () => job.Start("Hello world!", progress, cancelToken, pauseToken));
```

The server component periodically checks for available jobs using first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue method. The server is a simple .NET library and able to run inside a host .NET app, Azure WebJob, or Windows service. 

Sample host Shift server projects are provided as a starting point:
- [Shift.WinService](https://github.com/hhalim/Shift.WinService) is the standalone Windows service server component, multiple services can be installed in the same server. 
- [Shift.Topshelf](https://github.com/hhalim/Shift.Topshelf) is the open source Topshelf package version for Windows service. This project allows simpler debugging and deployment to Windows.
- [Shift.WebJob](https://github.com/hhalim/Shift.WebJob) is the Azure cloud WebJob app, multiple web jobs can also be deployed to multiple Azure App Services. 

## Demos
Check out the demo apps on how to integrate Shift into .NET application. The ASP.NET MVC demo shows Shift client and server running in the same ASP.NET process. The simpler console Shift client and server demos are two separate projects that demonstrate a client and a server working in two different processes.
- ASP.NET MVC demo: [Shift.Demo.Mvc](https://github.com/hhalim/Shift.Demo.Mvc)
- ASP.NET Core MVC demo: [Shift.Demo.Mvc.Core](https://github.com/hhalim/Shift.Demo.Mvc.Core)
- Console apps demo: [Shift.Demo.Client](https://github.com/hhalim/Shift.Demo.Client) and [Shift.Demo.Server](https://github.com/hhalim/Shift.Demo.Server)

## Quick Start and More
